Here's a structured explanation of what can be found in the **`project_root/`** repository **(currently under development)**, based on the given directory structure.

---

## **📂 Project Overview**
The **`project_root/`** directory contains code for a machine learning pipeline focused on protein classification. The structure is modular, with different folders handling **data loading, explainability, modeling, training, and utility functions**.  

This repository is **currently under development**, meaning that some features may be expanded or optimized.

## **🗂 Explanation of Each Folder**
Each folder serves a specific purpose within the pipeline.

### **📁 `dataset/` – Data Handling**
Handles **loading, processing, and structuring** protein datasets.
- **`dataset_loader.py`** → Loads CSV datasets and NumPy-encoded embeddings & attention weights.
- **`data_loader_factory.py`** → Creates PyTorch `DataLoader` objects from datasets.
- **`protein_dataset.py`** → Defines the `ProteinDataset` class for handling structured protein data.
- **`wrapped_protein_dataset.py`** → Extends `ProteinDataset` to apply dimensionality reduction techniques like **PCA and t-SNE**.

---

### **📁 `explainability/` – Model Interpretation**
Provides tools for **understanding model predictions** and data transformations.
- **`model_explainability.py`** → Uses SHAP, LIME, or other methods to analyze model decisions.
- **`pca_explainability.py`** → Analyzes PCA transformations and variance explained.

---

### **📁 `models/` – Neural Network Definition**
Defines the **protein classifier** model.
- **`protein_classifier.py`** → Implements a PyTorch-based deep learning model for protein classification.

---

### **📁 `training/` – Training Pipeline**
Manages **training, validation, and hyperparameter tuning**.
- **`trainer.py`** → Handles the training loop, evaluation, and metrics tracking.
- **`trainer_config.py`** → Stores hyperparameter settings for training.

---

### **📁 `utils/` – Helper Functions**
Stores **general-purpose utilities** for the project.
- **`data_loader_factory.py`** → (duplicate, consider removing) Handles dataset batching.
- **`feature_processor.py`** → Preprocessing functions for feature selection, scaling, etc.

---

## **🚀 Current Development Status**
✅ **Data Loading** → `dataset_loader.py` and `ProteinDataset` are functional.  
🔄 **Dimensionality Reduction** → `WrappedProteinDataset` is being debugged to ensure smooth PCA/t-SNE transformations.  
🛠 **Training & Model Explainability** → Not fully integrated yet; requires more testing.

---

## **🔜 Next Steps**
- ✅ **Fix `WrappedProteinDataset` initialization issues** (ongoing).  
- 🔄 **Integrate SHAP or LIME for model explainability**.  
- 🛠 **Expand `trainer.py` to handle advanced logging and monitoring**.  

---

## **🎯 Summary**
This repository is structured **for scalability and modularity**, with clear separations between:
- **Data Loading (`dataset/`)**
- **Dimensionality Reduction & Visualization (`explainability/`)**
- **Model Definition (`models/`)**
- **Training & Evaluation (`training/`)**
- **Utility Functions (`utils/`)**

This organization makes it easy to **expand** and **maintain** as new features are added! 🚀
